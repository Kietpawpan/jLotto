# jLotto
The jLotto is a digital lottery machine which randomly generates five winning numbers a round: four 3-digit numbers and a 2-digit number (e.g., 245 657 009 981 54). Each round the user chooses five numbers to play (any 2- or 3-digit numbers), and then click the Spin button; jLotto will generate the winning numbers, record them in the text file, and give a note only if the chosen number(s) matches any of the wining numbers.
