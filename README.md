# jLotto
The jLotto is a digital lottery machine (Lotto AI), which randomly generates five winning numbers per round: four 3-digit numbers and a 2-digit number (e.g., 245 657 009 981 54). Each round, the user selects five numbers to play (any 2- or 3-digit numbers). Then, click the Spin button; the AI will generate the winning numbers, record them in the text file, and give an extra note if the user's number(s) match any of the wining numbers.
